## Hi there 👋

<!--
**bjcarter34/bjcarter34** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Location: Redwood City, CA

My Fvorite Fluorophore/Metal-Isotope: Old School PacBlue, although I never really use it anymore.

Previous Coding Experience: Couple of classes over the years

What I hope to get from the course: Functional tools that I can share with my local community!
